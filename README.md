A repository containing all of the tabs and lesson for practicing effectively.

## Overview
This is an overview of the course. The TL;DR of the whole routine is that you're going to need to know all of your [scales positions](https://github.com/rrsolomon/The-Scale-Bible), your [Circle of Fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths), your diatonic triads, and diatonic 7th chords. This routine is designed to be the ultimate practice routine, and will go through every key. Mind you, in order to complete this routine in its full, you have to go through of the exercises for every key. It's very time consuming, and will take at least 5 hours or so to complete, however, if you're pressed on time, I suggest you do one set of exercises each day.

### Order of Operations
This is the order of the keys that you will practice this routine. You can get the result below by using this formula **3(n + 4), n + 5**.

This is how I got the following order.

1. C Major | A Minor
2. E Major| C# Minor
3. Ab Major | F Minor
4. G Major | E Minor
5. B Major (Cb Major) | G# Minor (Ab Minor)
6. Eb Major | C Minor
7. D Major | B Minor
8. F#/Gb Major | Eb/D# Minor
9. Bb Major | G Minor
10. A Major | F# Minor
11. Db Major (C# Major) | Bb Minor (A# Minor)
12. F Major | D minor
